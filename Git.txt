It will help to compare any changes made to older version to help fix mistakes and typos.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pro, Easily accessable. Cons, does not work off-line. No Editor, No Manual Save.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
The files are interconnected, a change in one file can multiple files.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Use git log to see the full log of changes. Use git diff to see what was changed.
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can always go back to find and change if an error was made.
